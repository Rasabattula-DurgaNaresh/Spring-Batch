This GitHub repository contains the code to accompany the Spring Batch Mastery course, and referred to from individual lecture episodes.
However, even if you are not enrolled in the course, please feel free to explore and run the code.
The repository contains 4 separate projects; each project is aimed to demonstrate Spring Batch concepts and features of the certain complexity:
 - Beginner Level: [first-batch-app](first-batch-app)
 - Intermediate Level: [second-batch-app](second-batch-app)
 - Advanced Level: [third-batch-app](third-batch-app)
 - Expert Level: [fourth-batch-app](fourth-batch-app)

While it's definitely possible to follow the code on your own, I highly recommend to join the course for the best learning experience :)
